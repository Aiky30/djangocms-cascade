Gallery
=======

A gallery is a collection of images displayed as a group. Since it normally consists of many similar
images, **djangocms-cascade** does not require to use child plugins for each image. Instead they
can be added directly to this gallery plugin. This simplifies the management of images.

Currently the GalleryPlugin is implemented without any decent template. If anybody knows a
good HTML snippet to represent a gallery/lightbox, please let me know. Otherwise I will
try with http://ashleydw.github.io/lightbox/
